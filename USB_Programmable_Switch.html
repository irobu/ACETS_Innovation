                    <li><strong>Project</strong> - In addition to generating speech, some clients need to control appliances or other devices in their environment. It is advantageous to use the communication device for this task because the optimal access method is already implemented for controlling the device. The access method on the device may be through switches, head mouse, or eye gaze control. On the other hand, external appliances/devices are controlled by switches, infra-red or radio signal, Wi-Fi, etc. 
Most battery operated toys can be modified so they are controlled by a switch. Similarly, electrical appliances (e.g., a lamp) can be turned on and off with the help of a switch and interface box with the ability to change switch activation function to include a time duration or an on/off latch mode.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Scenario/Client Description</strong> - Parents of a client using eye gaze for communication requested support for the child to be able to control battery operated toys through the use of eye gaze on the communication device to be able to initiate play at home or school. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Challanges</strong> - To date, there are available on the market devices that can control appliances (turn ON/OFF, timer, toggle), they require the use of a switch, a bulky interface, and are not programmable (the user has to manually change settings for each specific use).&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan of Action</strong> - A Programmable USB Switch was developed to control simultaneously three different external appliances. It connects to a USB port of the communication device to provide three output switches controlled by relays. The novelty of this device consists of its capability to use any access method (eye gaze for this particular client) and that can be programmed in advance or on the fly. This is done through a piece of software that sends to the USB Switch parameters such as port number, timing and delay parameter, state, etc. These commands can be implemented when programming the communication device. For example, in Grid communication software, in a page dedicated to “Play Activities” was programmed with individual button actions to command that the toy is connected to Port 1 and is to be activated for 10 seconds after a delay of 3 seconds. That command looks like the one on the bottom right where: DELAY = time in seconds before the action  ACTION is performed; PORT = the port (1, 2 or 3) that is being used; ACTION = the action to be performed at port PORT [0 - RESET (turns all ports off), 1 - turn port on, 2 - turn port off, 3 - toggle port, 4 - turn port on for o period of time specified in TIMER] and TIMER = duration in seconds for the timer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Outcomes/Feedback</strong> - This function was demonstrated to child’s primary school team with anticipation of introduction at school. Unfortunately, implementation did not occur as child’s device needed repair and then child had health issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflections/Future Work</strong> - Based on the feedback received from primary school clinicians and consulting ACETS team members, this provides opportunities for improved independence to initiate play. USB switch development can be used with other clients using established alternate access and will result in further improvements of the device by adding more programmable functions, output ports and even a wireless version of the device. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Date</strong> - January 2019</li>
